/*
  BUG #2 — State Issue

  This component displays a count and updates it when the button is clicked.
  However, the way the count is being changed causes the component to behave
  incorrectly.
*/

import { useState } from 'react';
export default function BugMutatedState() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAdd() {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bug 2 Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
/*
Changed let to const to prevent reassignment. Used an updater function inside 
'handleAdd' which calculates the new value based on the current state without 
changing the original variable. The new value is passed to setCount, and React 
updates and re-render the UI.
